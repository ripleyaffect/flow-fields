This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Included Components

- Most of the components from [ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com/) are included in the `src/components/ui` directory
- The [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) package is included for icons. Icons should be included individually, to support tree-shaking
- A theme toggle component for toggling between light, dark, and system themes
- A simple sticky nav bar component
